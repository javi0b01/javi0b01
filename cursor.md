### Roadmap
Cursor Learning Roadmap  
A simple, sequential guide for learning to use an AI code editor like Cursor, from basic to complex.
#### Level 1: Getting Started - The Fundamentals
1. **Installation & Setup:**
  * Download and install Cursor on your operating system.
  * Open an existing project or a new folder.
2. **UI Familiarization:**
  * Identify the main AI feature: the Chat panel.
  * Notice how it's built on a familiar editor (VS Code), so file browsing, terminal, and basic editing are the same.
3. **Your First AI Interaction ("Hello, World!"):**
  * Open any code file.
  * Highlight a function or a block of code.
  * In the chat panel, type "Explain this code" and press Enter.
### Level 2: Core AI-Assisted Coding
1. **AI Chat for Q&A:**
  * Ask general programming questions (e.g., "what's the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript?").
  * Paste an error message from your terminal into the chat and ask the AI to explain it and suggest a fix.
2. **Generating New Code:**
  * In an empty file, ask the AI to create boilerplate code (e.g., "Create a simple Express server in Node.js").
  * Use "Ctrl+K" (or "Cmd+K") to open an inline prompt to generate code right where your cursor is.
3. **Editing & Refactoring Existing Code:**
  * Highlight a block of code.
  * Press "Ctrl+K" (or "Cmd+K") to open the inline prompt.
  * Tell the AI what to do (e.g., "Convert this to an async/await function," "Refactor this to be more readable," or "Add error handling").
### Level 3: Leveraging Your Full Codebase
1. **Chatting with Your Codebase:**
  * Use the `@` symbol in the chat to reference specific files or folders (e.g., "What is the purpose of the `@/src/utils/api.js` file?").
  * Ask questions about the entire project (e.g., "Where is the user authentication logic handled in this codebase?").
2. **Context-Aware Code Generation:**
  * Ask the AI to write new code that follows existing patterns in your project (e.g., "Create a new function that fetches user data, following the style of the functions in `@/src/api/`").
3. **AI-Powered Debugging:**
  * Select a piece of code that has a bug.
  * Use the "Fix & Diff" feature to have the AI find the issue and propose a change, which you can review before applying.
### Level 4: Advanced Techniques & Workflow Integration
1. **Writing Tests:**
  * Point the AI to a function or class using the `@` symbol.
  * Ask it to generate unit tests (e.g., "Write Jest tests for the `@calculateTotal` function").
2. **Large-Scale Changes:**
  * Use the AI to help with migrating code (e.g., "Help me convert this class-based React component to a functional component with Hooks").
3. **Customizing AI Behavior (Rules):**
  * Create rules for the AI to follow for your project, ensuring it generates code that adheres to your team's specific conventions and style guides.
