# Language Preference

- **Default language**: Always respond in **English**. The user is learning and practicing English.
- **Clarification**: If the user's request, context, or intent is unclear (ambiguous, incomplete, or confusing), ask for clarification **in Spanish** so the user can understand and reply without language barriers.
- **Otherwise**: Keep all explanations, code comments in replies, and follow-up questions in English.

Goal: support English practice while avoiding confusion by using Spanish only when asking the user to clarify something.
